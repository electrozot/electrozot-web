# Technician Booking System in PHP

### About Technician Booking System PHP Project

This Technician Booking System Project in PHP focuses on managing technicians and technician reservations. The system helps to keep track of technicians and their booking details. The system displays all available technicians and allows users to book them. Additionally, the system allows adding customers. This project contains an admin panel with a user panel. Users can register themselves to use the system, whereas technicians are added manually by the administrator. Users can view all available technicians for booking. There, the users can book technicians and confirm their booking information. Also, the users can cancel and view their booking records. Besides, the users can send feedback to the system administrator.

### Instructions: How to Run?

1.  After you finish downloading the project, unzip the project file and head over to your XAMPP/Laragon directory. <br/>
2.  There you'll find a folder named "htdocs". <br/>
3.  Inside the "htdocs" folder, paste the project folder (not the .zip one, but the extracted one). <br/>
4.  Open your favorite browser; we recommend using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. <br/>
5.  Then, go to the URL "http://localhost/phpmyadmin". <br/>
6.  Create a Database with a name that is provided inside the "01 LOGIN DETAILS & PROJECT INFO.txt". <br/>
7.  Click on the "Import" tab and choose the database file (.sql) which is provided under the folder naming "DATABASE FILE". <br/>
8.  After setting up all these, go to the URL "http://localhost/[ PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME ]/" <br/>
9.  All the login details are provided inside the project folder, check that out and enter them in order to use it. <br/>

For this particular PHP project, PHP Version 5.6.3 or 7.4.12 is required because it's well tested on both. So, users with the latest PHP version (greater than 7.4.12) might face various errors while operating it. As a result, you'll need to downgrade your PHP version (only if you're using the latest version) at the moment.
